    <!-- How do you start a community garden? -->

    <h2>How Do You Start A Community Garden?</h2>
    <h3>Community gardens are essential in every neighborhood! Here are 7 steps on how to start one:</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Find available land</b>
            <br> You will need to find a decent plot of land that is available, near water, and has 
            decent soil or enough ground to build containers.</li>
            <li><b>Build engagement with your community</b>
            <br> Let the community know what you're doing! You will need a team to help you build your 
            dream community garden.</li>
            <li><b>Find resources to support your garden</b>
            <br> Raise the funds. Most community gardens cost between $3,750 to $7,500 but there are 
            grants and sponsorships available that can help you get started.</li>
            <li><b>Decide what to plant with the help of your neighbors</b>
            <br> You need to start thinking about the local climate, sunlight, and soil conditions. 
            Which fruits and vegetables grow during which seasons? What produce would my community 
            need the most? </li>
            <li><b>Build the site</b>
            <br> Decide how you will divide the site and if you prefer individual plots or individual beds 
            and start building.</li>
            <li><b>Set out rules</b>
            <br> You will need a schedule. Who will water the gardens? How will you manage the weeds? 
            Will the shifts rotate and when? </li>
            <li><b>Maintain and grow your garden!</b>
            <br> Keep the garden and the excitement of the community growing! Share in your success 
            and your garden will flourish. </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
